            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I am currently a student at Northeastern University studying for a Master's degree in computer science. Although I was raised in Santa Cruz, California, I graduated from Brandeis University with a Bachelor's degree in Math and Studio Art. My passion for creative problem-solving led me to a career in finance, but after a few years, I realized I needed work that was more meaningful-for myself and my clients.</p>

            <p>A foundational knowledge of design and logic led me to study programming and web design at UMASS Lowell, where I earned a Bachelor's in Information Technology with a Certificate in Web Design. I now live in Billerica, Massachusetts with my fianc√©, Dan, and our two adorable cats, Maggie and Baxter. I like to spend my free time playing video games, renovating my home and painting.</p>

            <h3>When I'm not designing websites...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There is nothing more rewarding than being loved by your pets! I make sure I spend plenty of time with my two furbabies, Maggie & Baxter.</li>
                <li>I love to sit down in front of the fire to play a game of Sid Meier's Civilization with my housemates</li>
                <li>I dabble in various art forms: painting, diamond painting, sculpting ceramics and wood working.</li>
            </ul>
